# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
        We first started by talking about what we wanted out project to be, then decided on an escape room. 
    Then we talked about what we wanted the theme of out escape room to be and we decided on stuck in a cabin. Then we sketched an idea of what we may have wanted to have our cabin look like and what we wanted in the cabin. First we talked about only having one room with a few clues, but that seems too simple, especially for the user because the game would be finished relatively fast. We then talked and decided on having two rooms and having many more clues and different ways to get the clues. 
        To start writing the code we then split up the files that needed to be created and wrote what we
    though each file needed to incorporate. We then worked on the files together to find anything that may not work or be needed as well as anything that needed to be added. Once the files were finished we started on the Main method and once again split up the if statements between living room and bedroom. Then we went through them all to find anything that may be missing or needed or anything that may not work as indended. Finally to debug, once we had all the if statements we needed, we started playing through the game and anytime we found something that didn't work as intended or skipped lines in an if statement we went to the corrisponding if statement and worked on anything that needed to be fixed or changed.

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
        Some new things that we figured out how to use during this project was a hashmap with a key and 
    multiple values. This was used for the drawers in the nightstand and dresser because they all needed different keys (number of the drawer), and messages.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
        We wish we had implemented the classes of our objects better and more often. We had planned on 
    using the methods more often but we ended up putting everything into one file. Implementing this may bave also helped with better readability.

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
        We would've liked to add a way to re-read clues and have more rule descriptions which would have 
    helped with clarity and standardization of what commands could be used when.

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
        The most helpful feedback was given by anyone who played the game while we were debugging and 
    helped us find anything that didn't work properly by using different ways to do things that we wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
        We would tell out past selves to do more sooner and leave more time for debugging everything. We
    believe that about half of the alloted time should be blocked out for just debugging the code. And any left over time coulve be used for any additional or last minute things to be added.

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
        Our team dynamic was pretty good because we were able to meet a lot in person which resulted in 
    good communication and the ability to work on seperate things at once and still being able to help each other.
